    <h1>All About Kyle</h1>
    </header>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Kyle. I am currently a student at Columbia University's Business School<a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode"> Justice Through Code</a> which is a program that teaches justice-impacted students how to code. I am currently in the first section of the program called <em>Foundations</em> which teaches students how to be job ready, prepare for interviews and the background checks, and how to write cover letters. Additionally, we are learning the foundations of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and will be finishing with an introduction to a few other languages. If successful in this first part, I will be ready to take the assessment and move on to the second section, <em>Tech Pathways</em>. </p>

    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
    <p>I have been fortunate to have attend several different schools for different parts of my education, each of them unique in their own way. I always had a love of history and politics which is why I pursued the programs that I did. When I had to make a pivot, I was lucky to find Columbia's Justice Through Code program that is setting me up for my next career</p>

    <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I am an avid runner, and I am looking to run at least two half marathons this year. I have a few 5K runs coming up which will serve as good warms up and practices, and then have a 10K as well in April. I have only run one half-marathon before, so my goal would be to beat that time. I just have to maintain my training schedule!<br>
<br>
      I am also a huge NFL fan, and I have been a fan of the Green Bay Packers since I first watched them in the 1998 Super Bowl. I also love playing video games, and I am currently replaying the Halo series on my Xbox.
    </p>

    <h1>Professional Experience and Goals</h1>
  <p> I have been fortunate to work in some very interesting roles in my life and they have taken me all across the globe. I have spent significant time in Europe and different parts of the United States, with smaller but amazingly rewarding trips to different parts of Africa and Central America. I genuinely miss working for the government in the capacity that I did, as I truly believe we were making the world a safer place. I am now currently working at a Michelin star restaurant just outside San Diego, which has been an incredible place to build community but not part of the long term plans. I am also a freelance consultant working in project management, where I am working on a software implementation project with the client switching over to Salesforce from Zendesk. My goal, particularly with this program, is to stay in the PM realm but being able to manage more technical projects</p>
